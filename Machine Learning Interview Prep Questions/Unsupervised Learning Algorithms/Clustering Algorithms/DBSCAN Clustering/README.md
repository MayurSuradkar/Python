# DBSCAN Clustering from Scratch (No ML Libraries, No Classes)

This notebook walks you through a simple implementation of **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** using only **NumPy**. It is designed for students and beginners to understand how clustering by density works, without relying on `scikit-learn`.

---

## What Youâ€™ll Learn

- What DBSCAN is and how it works
- Key terms: **core points**, **border points**, and **noise**
- How to implement DBSCAN step-by-step:
  - Compute point-to-point distances
  - Find dense neighborhoods (region queries)
  - Expand clusters recursively
- How to visualize DBSCAN results

---

## What is DBSCAN?

DBSCAN groups together points that are **close to each other** (high-density regions), and marks points in **low-density regions** as **outliers (noise)**.

### Main Parameters:
- `eps`: The distance threshold to search for neighboring points
- `min_samples`: Minimum number of neighbors (including self) to form a dense cluster

### Point Types:
| Type         | Definition |
|--------------|------------|
| Core Point   | Has at least `min_samples` neighbors within `eps` |
| Border Point | Has fewer than `min_samples`, but is within `eps` of a core point |
| Noise        | Neither core nor border (considered outlier) |
