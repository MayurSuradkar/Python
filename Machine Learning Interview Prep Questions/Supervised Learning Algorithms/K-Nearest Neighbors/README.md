# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from Scratch (No Libraries)

This notebook provides a step-by-step implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm using **NumPy only**, no `scikit-learn` or machine learning libraries.

KNN is one of the simplest and most intuitive ML algorithms. It’s perfect for beginners to learn classification logic and **distance-based learning**.

- How to compute **Euclidean distance** between points  
- How to implement the **majority vote** prediction  
- How to visualize classification and test points  
- Why KNN is called a **lazy learning** algorithm

## Why It’s Great for Interviews
Understanding KNN helps with:
  * Explaining distance-based algorithms
  * Building a mental model for nearest-neighbor logic
  * Discussing trade-offs in model complexity vs simplicity
  * Writing simple models without relying on libraries

---

## Suggested Extensions
* Try different values of K
* Add support for weighted voting
* Use other distance metrics (e.g., Manhattan)
* Extend to multi-class datasets
* Add accuracy evaluation on test data
