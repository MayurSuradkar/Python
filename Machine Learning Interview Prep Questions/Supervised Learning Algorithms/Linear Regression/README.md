# Linear Regression from Scratch

This repository contains a simplified implementation of **Linear Regression** from scratch using only **NumPy**.  
It's designed for beginners to understand and implement the core concepts of linear regression without relying on machine learning libraries.

## What You Will Learn

- How linear regression models the relationship between input features and output targets  
- The concept of gradient descent to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss  
- Step-by-step parameter updates for weights and bias  
- How to visualize the training data and the learned regression line  
- How to evaluate model performance using the RÂ² score  

## How to Use This Notebook

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `simplified_linear_regression_from_scratch.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.  
3. Run the cells sequentially to see data generation, model training, visualization, and evaluation.  
4. Modify learning rate, epochs, or data to experiment and deepen your understanding.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment
