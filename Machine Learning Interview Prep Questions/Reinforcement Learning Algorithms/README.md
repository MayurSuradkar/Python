# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

This section of the repository covers essential **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** algorithms, implemented **from scratch using Python**. Each notebook is designed to be intuitive, interview-ready, and classroom-friendly, ideal for students and professionals who want to understand RL from the ground up.

## What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement Learning is a branch of Machine Learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by interacting with an **environment** to maximize cumulative **rewards**.

Instead of learning from labeled data, the agent learns by **trial and error**, receiving feedback in the form of **rewards or penalties**.

> “An RL agent learns **what to do**, given a situation, by trying actions and observing results.”

## Key Concepts

| Term        | Meaning |
|:-------------|:---------|
| **Agent**   | Learner or decision-maker |
| **Environment** | External system the agent interacts with |
| **State (s)** | Snapshot of the environment |
| **Action (a)** | Move made by the agent |
| **Reward (r)** | Feedback from the environment |
| **Policy (π)** | Strategy that the agent uses to choose actions |
| **Value Function (V)** | Expected long-term reward from a state |
| **Q-Value (Q)** | Expected reward of taking an action in a given state |

## Algorithm Categories

Reinforcement Learning algorithms can be divided into:

### 1. Model-Free Methods

#### Value-Based
- `Q-Learning`
- `SARSA`
- `Deep Q-Network (DQN)`

#### Policy-Based
- `REINFORCE`
- `Policy Gradient`

#### Actor-Critic
- `A2C / A3C`
- `DDPG`
- `TD3`
- `SAC`
- `PPO`

---

### 2. Model-Based Methods
- `Dyna-Q`
- `Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)`
- `MuZero`

---

## Use Cases

- Self-driving cars
- Robotics
- Game-playing AI
- Trading bots
- Adaptive control systems
