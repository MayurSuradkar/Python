# Jupyter Notebooks
_A beginner-friendly guide to understanding and using Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and Python programming._

## What is Jupyter Notebook?
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web-based interactive development environment (IDE) that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

It supports over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia, but is most commonly used for Python in data science and machine learning.

## Key Features
- Interactive coding and immediate output
- Markdown support for documentation and notes
- Visualizations directly embedded into the notebook
- Easy export to PDF, HTML, and more
- Cell-based architecture (code cells and markdown cells)


## Getting Started

### Installation
To install Jupyter using pip:

```
pip install notebook
```

Or install through Anaconda (recommended for beginners):

```
conda install -c conda-forge notebook
```

### Launching Jupyter
Once installed, open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This will open the Jupyter interface in your default web browser.

## Working with Cells
Jupyter Notebooks are made up of cells.
- **Code Cells**: Write Python code and execute it with `Shift + Enter`.
- **Markdown Cells**: Write plain text, formatted notes, or documentation using Markdown.

### Example

```
# This is a Python code cell
print("Hello, world!")
```

```
# This is a Markdown cell
## Subheadings
**Bold text** and *italic text*
```

## Visualizations
Jupyter integrates seamlessly with data visualization libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. Example:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [10, 20, 25, 30]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Line Chart")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.show()
```

## Saving and Exporting
You can save your notebook anytime by clicking `File > Save` and Checkpoint or pressing `Ctrl + S`.

To export your notebook as PDF, HTML, or another format:

- Click `File > Download as > [your desired format]`
