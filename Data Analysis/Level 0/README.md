- Functions and modular code
- Input/output and string formatting

### 2. Basic Statistics
- Mean, median, mode
- Range, variance, and standard deviation
- Use of `numpy` and `statistics` modules

### 3. Probability & Distributions
- Probability fundamentals
- Uniform, binomial, and normal distributions
- Use of visualizations to interpret distributions

### 4. Jupyter Notebooks
- Installing and launching notebooks
- Markdown vs. code cells
- Writing and running Python interactively

### 5. Git & GitHub Basics
