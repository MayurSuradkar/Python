# Level 4: Build Real-World Experience

## Goal
The aim of Level 4 is to apply your data analysis skills to real-world problems across different domains.
Instead of isolated exercises, youâ€™ll work on end-to-end projects, from data collection to presentation, using realistic datasets.

## Why This Level Matters
- Develop hands-on experience with domain-specific problems.
- Learn to tell a story with data that influences decisions.
- Build a portfolio of professional projects for interviews and GitHub.


## Sample Projects
These projects are designed to simulate actual industry challenges:

1. **[Sales or Revenue Analysis](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Level%204/sales_revenue_analysis.ipynb)**: Identify sales trends, seasonal patterns, and revenue drivers to help optimize strategy.

2. **[Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Level%204/customer_segmentation_project.ipynb)**: Use clustering or demographic analysis to group customers for targeted marketing.

3. **[Product Usage Analysis](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Level%204/product_usage_analysis.ipynb)**: Understand how users interact with products to improve engagement and retention.

4. **[Financial Reporting](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Level%204/financial_reporting.ipynb)**: Create automated financial summaries, dashboards, and KPI reports for stakeholders.

5. **[Campaign Performance Analysis](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Level%204/campaign_performance_analysis.ipynb)**: Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns using CTR, conversion rates, and ROI.


## Recommended Tools
