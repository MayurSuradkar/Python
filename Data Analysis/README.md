# 🧠 Data Analysis Repository  
_A Complete Beginner-to-Intermediate Resource to Learn and Practice Data Analysis with Python_

## 📘 Overview

This repository is designed to help learners build a strong foundation in data analysis using Python. Whether you're preparing for interviews, brushing up your skills, or working on real-world projects, this repo offers simple, well-structured resources.

We focus on **clarity**, **practical examples**, and **hands-on learning** using Pandas and core Python libraries. No complex logic. No unnecessary jargon.
