## ðŸ§­ Roadmap: Become a Hero in Data Analysis

### 1. **Foundations of Python for Data Analysis**
- Learn Python syntax and data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.)
- Master loops, functions, conditionals
- Understand file handling (read/write files)

### 2. **Pandas for Tabular Data**
- Load CSV/Excel/JSON files using `read_*`
- Inspect data with `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`
- Filter, sort, slice and dice with conditions

### 3. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
- Handle missing data with `fillna()` and `dropna()`
- Correct data types using `astype()`
- Rename columns, reset index, drop duplicates

### 4. **Aggregation and Grouping**
- Use `groupby()` to summarize
- Apply aggregation functions: `mean()`, `sum()`, `count()`
- Pivot tables and multi-indexing

### 5. **Feature Engineering**
- Create new columns using operations and `apply()`
- Bin, categorize, encode data
- Merge, join, and concatenate multiple datasets

### 6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize trends and distributions using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Plot histograms, bar charts, boxplots
- Use `.corr()` to explore relationships

### 7. **Mini Projects & Practice**
- Analyze a small dataset from Kaggle or UCI
- Apply all steps: load â†’ clean â†’ analyze â†’ visualize â†’ conclude

### 8. **Interview Prep + Beyond**
- Practice with the 25 question set included in this repo
- Explore real-world datasets
- Begin learning SQL and basic statistics
