# Level 1: Data Wrangling 

_Work With Real Data_

## Goal
Learn how to clean, manipulate, and prepare datasets using powerful Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.

---

## What You’ll Learn

### 1. Pandas for Data Analysis
- Reading data from CSV, Excel, and JSON
- Selecting and filtering rows and columns
- Merging, joining, and concatenating datasets
- Grouping and aggregating data
- Applying functions with `.apply()`, `.map()`, and `.lambda`
- Transforming data with `.pivot()`, `.melt()`, `.stack()`, `.unstack()`

### 2. NumPy for Numerical Operations
- Creating and manipulating arrays
- Indexing, slicing, and reshaping
- Element-wise operations
- Broadcasting
- Aggregations like mean, median, std

### 3. Data Cleaning Techniques
- Handling missing data with `.fillna()`, `.dropna()`
- Detecting and fixing incorrect or inconsistent data
- Working with duplicate values

### 4. Data Types & Conversions
- Understanding `object`, `int`, `float`, `category`, `datetime`
- Type conversions using `.astype()` and `pd.to_datetime()`

### 5. Filtering, Sorting & Feature Creation
- Boolean indexing and advanced filtering
- Sorting by index or column values
- Creating new columns and features from existing ones

## Output

By completing this level, you will produce:

- Cleaned versions of raw datasets
- At least **3 wrangling notebooks** demonstrating:
  - Importing and inspecting datasets
  - Cleaning and reshaping data
  - Creating useful new features
- Practical examples like:
  - Cleaning sales data
  - Merging customer and transaction records
  - Handling missing and incorrect entries
