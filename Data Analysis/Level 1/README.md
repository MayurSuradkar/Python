# Level 1: Data Wrangling 

_Work With Real Data_

## Goal
Learn how to clean, manipulate, and prepare datasets using powerful Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.

## What You’ll Learn

### 1. [Pandas for Data Analysis](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Level%201/pandas_for_data_analysis_1.ipynb)
- Reading data from CSV, Excel, and JSON
- Selecting and filtering rows and columns
- Merging, joining, and concatenating datasets
- Grouping and aggregating data
- Applying functions with `.apply()`, `.map()`, and `.lambda`
- Transforming data with `.pivot()`, `.melt()`, `.stack()`, `.unstack()`

### 2. [NumPy for Numerical Operations](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Level%201/numPy_for_numerical_operations.ipynb)
- Creating and manipulating arrays
- Indexing, slicing, and reshaping
- Element-wise operations
- Broadcasting
- Aggregations like mean, median, and std

### 3. [Data Cleaning Techniques](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Level%201/data_cleaning_techniques_in_pandas.ipynb)
- Handling missing data with `.fillna()`, `.dropna()`
- Detecting and fixing incorrect or inconsistent data
- Working with duplicate values

### 4. [Data Types & Conversions](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Level%201/data_types_and_conversions.ipynb)
- Understanding `object`, `int`, `float`, `category`, `datetime`
- Type conversions using `.astype()` and `pd.to_datetime()`

### 5. Filtering, Sorting & Feature Creation
- Boolean indexing and advanced filtering
- Sorting by index or column values
- Creating new columns and features from existing ones
